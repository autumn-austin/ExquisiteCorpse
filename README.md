# ExquisiteCorpse
Hello there!

Here I've created a short little game called "Exquisite Corpse".

This game demonstrates knowledge of creating methods, methods with parameters, switch cases, random number generators, refactoring, and so on. 

To run this program, simply open the solution (.sln) file and build/run the project.

When the project is ran, you will automatically see a randomly generated monster in your terminal. 

Thanks, and happy coding!
